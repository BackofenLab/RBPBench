# RBPBench

RBPBench is multi-function tool to evaluate CLIP-seq and other genomic region data 
using a comprehensive collection of known RBP binding motifs. RBPBench can be used 
for a variety of purposes, from RBP motif search (database or user-supplied RBPs) 
in genomic regions, over motif co-occurrence analysis, to benchmarking CLIP-seq peak 
caller methods as well as comparisons across cell types and CLIP-seq protocols.
